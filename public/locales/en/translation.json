Maybe he/she worked so hard to get that job, he did not think he/she would not be satisfied, or could not get information from the employees who work there. At this point, we wanted to help the people who want to enter their dream job. Then we prepared some questions about the working conditions of that company. Current and previous employees can rate that company so People get some idea about the company conditions."

According to these schemes, we wrote the functions that will perform the saving process, then we created functions for the data we will fetch from our database and connected to the API."
